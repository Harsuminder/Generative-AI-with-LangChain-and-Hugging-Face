    "Parts of Speech (POS) tagging is the process of **labeling each word** in a sentence with its **grammatical role**, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. It helps in understanding the structure and meaning of a sentence.\n",

    "| Tag | Meaning         | Example           |\n",
    "|-----|------------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| NN  | Noun             | cat, car, London  |\n",
    "| VB  | Verb (base form) | run, eat, go      |\n",
    "| JJ  | Adjective        | big, red, fast    |\n",
