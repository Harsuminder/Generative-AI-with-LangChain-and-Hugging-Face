    "A **Simple RNN** is a neural network where outputs from previous time steps are fed back into the network as inputs. It learns patterns in sequential data, such as time series or text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses a **hidden state (`hₜ`)** to retain short-term memory.\n",
    "- Struggles with **long-term dependencies**, which LSTM/GRU solve.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **Bidirectional RNN** is an architecture where the model processes the input sequence **in both forward and backward directions**. This allows the network to have information from both **past** and **future** contexts at every time step.\n",

    "\n",
    "In standard (unidirectional) RNNs:\n",
    "- The model only looks at **past inputs** (left to right).\n",
    "- But sometimes, the **future context** is also important for better understanding.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Using **two RNN layers**:\n",
    "  - One processes the sequence from start to end.\n",
    "  - The other processes it from end to start.\n",
    "- Their outputs are **concatenated** or **merged**, providing richer context.\n",

    "To correctly predict the blank word, we need:\n",
    "- **Left context**: \"The cat\"\n",
    "- **Right context**: \"on the mat\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard RNN that only sees \"The cat\" might guess \"**meows**\" or \"**runs**\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A **BiRNN**, seeing both sides, can better predict that the correct word is \"**sat**\", because it understands the relationship between **\"cat\"** and **\"mat\"** — which suggests a sitting or resting action.\n",

    "With **BiRNN**, the model sees:\n",
    "- What came **before** and\n",

    "- **Standard RNN**: Only past context → 🔙\n",
    "- **BiRNN**: Past + future context → 🔙🔜\n",
    "- Improves performance on **sequence labeling and understanding tasks** by giving full visibility of the sequence at each time step.\n"
