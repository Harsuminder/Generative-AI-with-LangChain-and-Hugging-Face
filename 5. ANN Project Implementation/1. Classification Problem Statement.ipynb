    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìå Task Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to use an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to solve a **binary or multi-class classification problem** using **text data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìù Example Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** Sentences or text reviews (e.g., product reviews, tweets, etc.)  \n",
    "**Output:** Class label (e.g., Positive/Negative, Spam/Ham, Topic A/B/C)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üî° Input Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Text data cannot be directly fed into an ANN ‚Äî we must convert it into **numerical vectors**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use techniques like:\n",
    "  - **Bag of Words (BoW)**\n",
    "  - **TF-IDF vectors**\n",
    "  - **Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sentence becomes a **fixed-length vector** of size `n`, where `n` = vocabulary size or embedding size.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ ANN Model Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Train the network to **predict the correct class** based on input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "| Sentence         | Input Vector (x) | Label (y) |\n",
    "|------------------|------------------|-----------|\n",
    "| \"I love NLP\"     | [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]  | 1 (Positive) |\n",

    "- **Input Layer**: Vectorized text input (e.g., TF-IDF of size 1000)\n",
    "- **Hidden Layer(s)**: Dense layers with ReLU activation\n",
    "- **Output Layer**:\n",
    "  - `sigmoid` activation ‚Üí for **binary classification**\n",

    "1. Preprocess and vectorize text\n",
    "2. Feed vectors into ANN\n",
    "3. Apply forward propagation\n",
    "4. Compute predictions (`≈∑`)\n",
    "5. Compute loss:\n",
    "   - Binary Cross-Entropy (binary)\n",
    "   - Categorical Cross-Entropy (multi-class)\n",
    "6. Backpropagate to update weights\n",
