    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìù Example Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** Sentences or text reviews (e.g., product reviews, tweets, etc.)  \n",
    "**Output:** Class label (e.g., Positive/Negative, Spam/Ham, Topic A/B/C)\n",

    "\n",
    "Text data cannot be directly fed into an ANN ‚Äî we must convert it into **numerical vectors**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use techniques like:\n",
    "  - **Bag of Words (BoW)**\n",
    "  - **TF-IDF vectors**\n",
    "  - **Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sentence becomes a **fixed-length vector** of size `n`, where `n` = vocabulary size or embedding size.\n",
