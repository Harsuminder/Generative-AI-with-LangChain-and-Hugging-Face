    "## 📝 Problem Statement: Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews using RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** to perform **sentiment classification** on the **IMDB movie reviews dataset**. Each review in the dataset is a piece of unstructured text labeled as either **positive** or **negative** sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to capture the **sequential dependencies and contextual flow of language**, which are essential for understanding sentiment in longer or nuanced reviews. This project leverages the **temporal capabilities of RNNs** to effectively learn and model the sequence of words in each review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Objectives:\n",
    "- Preprocess and tokenize the IMDB review data\n",
    "- Convert textual reviews into padded sequences of word indices\n",
    "- Build an RNN-based classification model using Keras\n",
    "- Train the model to classify sentiments as **positive** or **negative**\n",
    "- Evaluate performance using accuracy and confusion matrix\n",
    "- Compare the results with baseline models (optional)\n"

    "## 🔁 What is an RNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** is a type of neural network designed for **sequential data**. Unlike traditional feedforward networks, RNNs have a **memory** of previous inputs, making them ideal for tasks like **language modeling**, **translation**, and **sentiment analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each time step, an RNN takes in:\n",
    "- The current word (as a vector)\n",
    "- The **hidden state** from the previous step  \n",
    "It then produces a new hidden state, which is passed forward in the sequence.\n",

    "## 🧠 Feeding Words into RNNs: The Role of Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Text data (like movie reviews) can't be fed into an RNN directly — we first need to **convert words into numerical vectors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text → Token**  \n",
    "   Each word is converted into an integer  \n",
    "   _Example_: `[\"great\", \"movie\"]` → `[345, 21]`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Token → Vector (Embedding Layer)**  \n",
    "   These integers are passed through an **embedding layer**, which maps each word to a **dense vector** (e.g., `[0.25, -0.1, ..., 0.05]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is where the model learns **semantic meaning** — similar words get similar vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Embedding → RNN Input**  \n",
    "   The sequence of word vectors is passed one at a time to the RNN. At each time step:\n",
    "   - The RNN receives the current word's embedding\n",
    "   - It updates its **hidden state**, capturing the context so far\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- RNNs process sequences **word by word**, retaining memory through hidden states.\n",
    "- Words are first **tokenized**, then converted to **dense vectors using embeddings**.\n",
    "- The embedding layer allows the model to **learn meaningful representations** of words based on context.\n"
