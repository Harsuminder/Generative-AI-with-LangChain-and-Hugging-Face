    "### ‚ùå Problems with Basic Encoder-Decoder (Seq2Seq)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Encoder-Decoder model works well for short sequences, it faces serious **limitations** when handling longer or complex sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed-Length Context Vector Bottleneck**\n",
    "   - The encoder compresses the entire input sentence into a **single vector**.\n",
    "   - This works okay for short inputs, but it becomes a **bottleneck** for long or information-rich sequences.\n",
    "   - Important information from earlier parts of the sentence may be **lost or diluted**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Long-Term Dependency Struggles**\n",
    "   - Even with LSTM/GRU, the model **forgets details** from earlier tokens.\n",
    "   - This affects performance, especially for tasks like long document translation or summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Poor Alignment Between Input and Output**\n",
    "   - The decoder generates words without explicitly knowing **which input words to focus on**.\n",
    "   - This leads to **generic, vague, or incorrect outputs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation with BLEU Score**\n",
    "   - In NLP, performance is often measured using the **BLEU score** (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy).\n",
    "   - BLEU compares the predicted output to one or more **reference translations** using n-gram overlap.\n",
    "   - A low BLEU score indicates **poor quality or unfaithful translation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Solution: Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these limitations, the **Attention Mechanism** was introduced ‚Äî a game-changer in sequence-to-sequence models.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîç **How It Helps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of relying on a single context vector, the decoder can **\"attend to\" different parts** of the input sequence at each step.\n",
    "- It calculates **attention weights** to decide **which encoder outputs** are most relevant to the current decoding step.\n",
    "- This allows the model to **dynamically focus** on different words as it generates each token.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† **Key Benefits**:\n",
    "- Handles **long sentences** better.\n",
    "- Improves **alignment** between input and output.\n",
    "- Leads to **higher BLEU scores** and **more accurate outputs**.\n",
    "- Foundation for modern architectures like **Transformers** and **BERT/GPT**.\n",
