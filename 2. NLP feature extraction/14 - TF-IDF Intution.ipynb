    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF** stands for **Term Frequency‚ÄìInverse Document Frequency**. It is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection (corpus).\n",
    "\n",
    "It combines two ideas:\n",
    "- **TF (Term Frequency):** How often a word appears in a document.\n",
    "- **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency):** How rare that word is across all documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Why use TF-IDF?\n",
    "While Bag of Words (BoW) treats all words equally, **TF-IDF gives more weight to rare and meaningful words**, and reduces the impact of common words that appear in many documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is widely used in:\n",
    "- Document classification\n",
    "- Information retrieval (e.g., search engines)\n",
    "- Text similarity and clustering\n"
