    "- **Simple, Intuitive, and Easy to Implement**  \n",
    "  One-hot encoding is conceptually simple and beginner-friendly. It's easy to implement using popular Python libraries:\n",
    "  - `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder` (scikit-learn)\n",
    "  - `pandas.get_dummies()` for quick one-hot encoding of categorical columns\n",
    "- **Preserves Word Identity**  \n",
    "  Clearly distinguishes between different words.\n",
    "- **Order-Invariant**  \n",
    "  Each word is treated independently and equally.\n",

    "### ‚ùå Disadvantages:\n",
    "- **High Dimensionality**  \n",
    "  The size of each vector equals the size of the vocabulary. In real-world NLP applications, vocabularies can contain **tens or hundreds of thousands of unique words**, making one-hot vectors extremely large and inefficient to store and process.\n",
    "- **Sparsity and Overfitting Risk**  \n",
    "  One-hot vectors are mostly zeros, leading to **sparse representations** that waste memory and computation. Sparse, high-dimensional inputs can also increase the risk of **overfitting**, especially with small datasets or simple models.\n",
    "- **Variable-Length Inputs**  \n",
    "  Each sentence may contain a different number of words, so encoding results in sequences of different lengths. Many models require **fixed-size inputs**, which means you‚Äôll need additional steps like **padding**, **truncating**, or aggregating.\n",
    "- **No Semantic Meaning or Similarity Awareness**  \n",
    "  One-hot vectors don‚Äôt capture any semantic information. Words like ‚Äúcat‚Äù and ‚Äúdog‚Äù are no more similar than ‚Äúcat‚Äù and ‚Äúbanana.‚Äù This makes it difficult to use one-hot vectors for tasks that depend on meaning, such as semantic search, clustering, or recommendations.\n",
    "- **No Context Awareness**  \n",
    "  A word has the same vector regardless of where or how it‚Äôs used in a sentence. For example, the word ‚Äúbank‚Äù will have the same encoding whether it refers to a riverbank or a financial institution.\n",
    "- **Cannot Handle Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words**  \n",
    "  One-hot encoding depends entirely on a fixed vocabulary. Any word not present during training is unknown at inference time ‚Äî there‚Äôs **no fallback**, which is a major issue in dynamic, real-world data streams like tweets, chats, or user-generated content.\n",

    "üîç **Why It Still Matters**  \n",
