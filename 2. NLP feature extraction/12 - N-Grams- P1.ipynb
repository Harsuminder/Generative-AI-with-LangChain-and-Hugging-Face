    "## üìå What Are N-Grams?\n",
    "\n",
    "**N-Grams** are continuous sequences of *n* words from a sentence. They help preserve **word order** and **local context**, which are crucial for understanding meaning in Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "N-Grams are commonly categorized as:\n",
    "- **Unigram (n = 1):** Single words  \n",
    "- **Bigram (n = 2):** Pairs of consecutive words  \n",
    "- **Trigram (n = 3):** Triplets of consecutive words\n",
    "\n",
    "They are widely used in tasks such as **language modeling**, **text classification**, and **sentiment analysis**, especially where word sequence impacts meaning.\n",

    "### üîç Why Not Just Use Bag of Words?\n",
    "\n",
    "While **Bag of Words (BoW)** captures word frequency, it completely ignores the **order** of words. This leads to major issues in understanding meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentence 1**: `\"Food is good\"`  \n",
    "- **Sentence 2**: `\"Food is not good\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Their BoW vectors might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Word     | food | is | good | not |\n",
    "|----------|------|----|------|-----|\n",
    "| Sentence 1 |  1   | 1  |  1   |  0  |\n",
    "| Sentence 2 |  1   | 1  |  1   |  1  |\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite opposite sentiment, BoW treats these as nearly identical as vectors are almost identical. \n",
