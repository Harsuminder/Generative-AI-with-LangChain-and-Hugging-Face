    "### ✅ Advantages\n",
    "- **Simple & Effective**: Easy to implement and widely used in text mining and search engines.\n",
    "- **No Training Required**: Purely statistical, doesn’t rely on labeled data or training.\n",
    "- **Fixed-Length Vector Representation**  \n",
    "  TF-IDF generates consistent, fixed-size vectors based on vocabulary size — independent of document length.  \n",
    "  ✅ This makes it easy to plug into ML models without padding or truncation.\n",
    "- **Highlights Important Words**  \n",
    "  Bag of Words (BoW) gives **equal importance** to all words — it simply counts how many times each word appears, without considering how informative or distinguishing that word actually is.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ✅ In contrast, **TF-IDF emphasizes words that are rare and more meaningful across the corpus**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  🔍 For example, consider the words:\n",
    "  - \"engineer\" (appears in few documents)\n",
    "  - \"project\" (appears in many documents)\n",
    "\n",
    "  BoW treats both the same — a count of 2 is just a 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "  But in TF-IDF:\n",
    "  - \"engineer\" will receive a **higher weight** because it appears in fewer documents — making it more specific and informative.\n",
    "  - \"project\" will have a **lower weight** since it's common across many documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ✅ This helps TF-IDF models focus on **content-rich, distinctive words**, rather than just frequent ones.\n",
    "\n"

    "### ❌ Disadvantages\n",
    "- **Ignores Context & Semantics**: Treats words independently; can't understand meaning, sarcasm, or word order.\n",
    "- **Sparse & High-Dimensional Vectors**: Especially with large vocabularies.\n",
    "- **Fixed Vocabulary**: Doesn’t handle unseen (OOV) words well.\n",
    "- **Assumes Term Independence**: No understanding of synonymy or phrase structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In short: TF-IDF is a great **baseline method**, but lacks the depth of modern techniques like **word embeddings** or **transformers**."
