    "## 📌 What is Backpropagation Through Time?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), we process input **step by step**, using hidden states to carry forward **contextual memory**.  \n",
    "After computing the final output and **loss**, the model must **update its parameters** to improve performance — this happens through **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "BPTT is an extension of backpropagation used for **sequential models**, where **gradients flow backward not just through layers**, but also **across time steps**.\n",
