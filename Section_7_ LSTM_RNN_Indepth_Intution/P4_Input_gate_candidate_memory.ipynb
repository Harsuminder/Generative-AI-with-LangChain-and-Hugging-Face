    "## üß† LSTM RNN ‚Äì Step-by-Step Explanation of Input Gate, Candidate Memory, and Cell State Update\n",

    "\n",
    "### üîÑ Quick Recap of the LSTM RNN Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In an LSTM RNN, the cell has two memory pathways:\n",
    "- **Short-Term Memory**: The hidden state `h‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ`\n",
    "- **Long-Term Memory**: The cell state `C‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ`\n",
    "\n",
    "The update to the memory (`C‚Çú`) is controlled by three gates:\n",
    "1. **Forget Gate** ‚Äì Decides what old info to erase.\n",
    "2. **Input Gate** ‚Äì Decides what new info to add.\n",
    "3. **Output Gate** ‚Äì Decides what to send to the next layer/time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üü° Step 1: Input Gate ‚Äì Controls *What New Info to Store*\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the input gate as a **filter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks at:\n",
    "- The **current input** (`x‚Çú`)\n",
    "- The **previous hidden state** (`h‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ`)\n",
    "\n",
    "It outputs a vector of values between 0 and 1 (after applying a sigmoid function). These values **scale** the amount of new information that can be added to the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: If the input gate outputs `[0.8, 0.2, 0.0]`, it means:\n",
    "- Store most of the new info in the first dimension\n",
    "- Store a little in the second\n",
    "- Store nothing in the third\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üü© Step 2: Candidate Memory ‚Äì Proposes *What the New Info Is*\n",
    "\n",
    "The **candidate memory** (also called \"memory content\") is a vector containing new information **proposed to be written** into the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector is created using the current input and the previous hidden state, passed through a tanh activation (which outputs values between -1 and 1). It‚Äôs like a suggestion for what the cell could remember next.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Candidate memory = `[0.5, -0.3, 0.7]`  \n",
    "‚Äî This means the cell is proposing to:\n",
    "- Add positive info in the 1st dimension\n",
    "- Remove/penalize info in the 2nd\n",
    "- Add strong positive info in the 3rd\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÅ Step 3: Combine with Forget Gate and Update Cell State\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the new cell state `C‚Çú`:\n",
    "1. The **Forget Gate** decides how much of the **old memory** `C‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ` should be kept.\n",
    "2. The **Input Gate** scales the **new proposed memory**.\n",
    "3. The cell **adds** both parts together to update the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way:\n",
    "- The model can **retain context** for long sequences.\n",
    "- It can **delete unhelpful info** (via forget gate).\n",
    "- It can **add new knowledge** (via input gate and candidate memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß™ Intuition with Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs say:\n",
    "- The forget gate gives `[0.9, 0.2, 0.1]` ‚Üí Keep 90% of old info in dim 1, 20% in dim 2, 10% in dim 3.\n",
    "- The input gate gives `[0.88, 0.26, 0.5]` ‚Üí Allow medium-to-high new info in dims 1 and 3.\n",
    "- The candidate memory gives `[0.46, -0.29, 0.76]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "- **Old memory contribution** = forget gate * old memory\n",
    "- **New memory contribution** = input gate * candidate memory\n",
    "- **Updated memory** = sum of above two\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the LSTM learns **when to remember, when to forget, and what to focus on**.\n",
