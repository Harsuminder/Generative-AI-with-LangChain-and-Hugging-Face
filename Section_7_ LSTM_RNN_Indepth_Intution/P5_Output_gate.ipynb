    "## üö™ Output Gate in LSTM RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Purpose of the Output Gate\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Output Gate** decides **what part of the updated memory (`C‚Çú`) should be revealed** to the next time step or layer as the hidden state (`h‚Çú`), which also serves as the **short-term memory** of the LSTM RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "It acts as a filter ‚Äî taking the current input `x‚Çú`, the previous hidden state `h‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ`, and the **updated cell state `C‚Çú`**, and decides how much of this processed memory should become the visible output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÅ How It Works ‚Äì Step by Step\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input**: The gate takes in:\n",
    "   - `x‚Çú`: Current input\n",
    "   - `h‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ`: Previous hidden state\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute Output Gate Values**:  \n",
    "   - These inputs are passed through a dense layer + sigmoid activation, producing values between **0 and 1**.\n",
    "   - These values control **how much of each element of the memory should be output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transform Cell State**:  \n",
    "   - The updated cell state `C‚Çú` is passed through a **tanh** activation to scale it to [-1, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Output**:  \n",
    "   - Multiply the **tanh-activated memory** with the **output gate values**.\n",
    "   - The result is `h‚Çú` ‚Äî the hidden state (short-term memory) passed to the next time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß™ Example with Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs say:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Updated cell state `C‚Çú = [0.6, -0.9, 0.3]`\n",
    "- Output gate (after sigmoid) gives: `o‚Çú = [0.7, 0.1, 0.9]`\n",
    "- `tanh(C‚Çú) = [tanh(0.6), tanh(-0.9), tanh(0.3)] ‚âà [0.537, -0.716, 0.291]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Final hidden state (h‚Çú) = o‚Çú √ó tanh(C‚Çú)\n",
    "                        ‚âà [0.7 √ó 0.537, 0.1 √ó -0.716, 0.9 √ó 0.291]\n",
    "                        ‚âà [0.376, -0.072, 0.262]\n"
