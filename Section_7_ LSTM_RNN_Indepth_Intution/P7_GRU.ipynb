    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Why LSTM RNNs Can Be Complex\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM RNNs were designed to solve the **long-term dependency** issue found in vanilla RNNs by introducing a **memory cell (`Cₜ`)** that acts like long-term memory and a hidden state (`hₜ`) that captures short-term memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTMs use **three gates**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forget Gate (`fₜ`)** – decides what to forget from the past memory.\n",
    "- **Input Gate (`iₜ`)** – decides what new information to store.\n",
    "- **Output Gate (`oₜ`)** – decides what to output at this time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each gate comes with its **own set of weights (`Wf`, `Wi`, `Wo`, `Wc`) and biases**, all of which are **trainable parameters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result:\n",
    "- The model becomes **parameter-heavy**.\n",
    "- **Training time increases**.\n",
    "- Model tuning and regularization become more difficult.\n",

    "---\n",

    "## 🧠 Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU): A Simpler Alternative\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the **complexity of LSTM RNNs**, GRUs were introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "GRUs **combine the memory roles** and remove the cell state `Cₜ` altogether. Instead, they maintain a **single hidden state `hₜ`** to capture both long-term and short-term dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Key Features of GRU\n",

    "- **Fewer gates** → Only 2 gates:\n",
    "  1. **Update Gate (`zₜ`)**: Controls how much of the past information to retain.\n",
    "  2. **Reset Gate (`rₜ`)**: Controls how much of the past to forget during candidate activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No separate memory cell** → The hidden state `hₜ` serves both as short-term and long-term memory.\n",
    "- **Fewer parameters** → Faster training and reduced risk of overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🧮 GRU Equations\n",
