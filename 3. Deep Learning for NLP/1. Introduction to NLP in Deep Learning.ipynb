    "# 🤖 Deep Learning for NLP – Introduction\n",

    "\n",
    "## 📌 Why Deep Learning for NLP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional NLP methods like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or static word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec) often fall short when it comes to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Capturing **word order**\n",
    "- Understanding **context**\n",
    "- Handling **ambiguity**\n",
    "- Learning **long-range dependencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning overcomes these challenges by learning features **automatically** from large volumes of text using neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Deep Learning in NLP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Learning for NLP** refers to applying multi-layered neural networks to understand and generate human language. It allows models to learn from **raw text** and perform tasks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text classification (e.g., spam detection)\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis\n",
    "- Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n",
    "- Question answering\n",
    "- Text generation (e.g., chatbot responses, story writing)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s understand how different types of neural networks work and how they relate to NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** is the simplest type of deep learning model, consisting of fully connected layers. It's commonly used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification** (e.g., image recognition, sentiment prediction)\n",
    "- **Regression** (e.g., predicting prices, sales)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Input to ANN:\n",
    "- Numerical features (age, salary, temperature)\n",
    "- Encoded categorical data (e.g., one-hot or label-encoded)\n",
    "- Flattened image pixels\n",
    "- TF-IDF or Bag of Words vectors (in early NLP models)\n",
    "\n",
    "While ANN is powerful, it **does not handle sequences well**, as it doesn’t consider word order or context in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally designed for images, **CNNs** are also useful in **text classification tasks**. They apply filters over n-grams (word sequences) to extract **local patterns** in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CNNs work well for fixed-length inputs like:\n",
    "  - Sentiment analysis\n",
    "  - Spam detection\n",
    "  - News categorization\n",
    "\n",
    "They are good at capturing local dependencies (like phrases) but still **don’t handle sequences or long-term context** well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌀 Introducing Sequential Data in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text is inherently sequential** — the order of words matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"I love you\"` ≠ `\"You love I\"`\n",
    "- `\"The cat sat on the mat\"` has structure and flow\n",
    "\n",
    "To model this, we need networks that understand **order** and **dependencies over time** — this is where **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and their variants like **LSTMs** and **GRUs** come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✍️ Text Generation – A Sequential Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models like RNNs and Transformers can generate coherent text, character by character or word by word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt**: `\"Once upon a time\"`  \n",
    "**Generated output**:  \n",
    "> \"Once upon a time, there lived a wise old owl in the heart of a magical forest...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of task relies on learning the **probability of the next word** given the previous ones, which only deep models with memory or attention can achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Deep learning has revolutionized NLP by enabling models to learn **context-aware**, **semantic-rich**, and **task-adapted** representations of language. \n"
